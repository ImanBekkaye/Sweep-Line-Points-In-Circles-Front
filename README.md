# Sweep-Line-Points-In-Circles-Front

This is a React-based visualization tool for the Sweep Line algorithm that solve the Points In Circles problem. The algorithmic implementation used in this project is available in another repository. [Sweep-Line-Points-In-Circles](https://github.com/ImanBekkaye/Sweep-Line-Points-In-Circles.git) 

## Introduction

This project provides a visual representation of the Sweep Line algorithm to solve the Points In Circles problem.
The tool provides a visual representation of the points that lie inside the generated circles, which are painted in red for easy identification.

## Usage

To use this visualizer, you can clone the repository and run the following command:

npm install


This will install all the necessary dependencies. You can then start the development server by running:

npm start


This will start the server and open the app in your default browser. The visualization tool allows you to enter the coordinates of the points and the circles, and see the order in which the circles intersect each other as we sweep a line from left to right.
